# Bank Management System

Designed and developed a bank management system using Java and Java Swing Components that managed bank operations. Utilized Object-Oriented Programming design pattern to construct a much more efficient program.

User authentication is required to access the user's account. The app implements CRUD operations which allows bank users or admin users to manage their accounts.
